# Assignment 3 processes


## Foreword
* The program is a shape area calculator based off of the program in the shape_area_calculator.py file in the day02 folder. The calculation function (the “business logic”) is saved in this folder (day03) in shape_area_calculator.py and can be used via GUI by running main.py.
* The program has been tweaked but no third-party python libraries have been imported to replace original code used for calculations, since the calculations are very basic.

Prompts:
* “Create a new file in folder "day03" that includes the code from "shape_area_calculator.py" in folder "day02", but only the part of the program that runs the calculations, without the GUI part. Then, in the "main.py" file in folder "day03", write code that will run the shape area calculator program from the same folder, implementing it through a GUI in the same way that it is implemented in the original file in "day02" folder.”
* Create a new file "tests.py" that will check my shape area calculator code. It will run a few example inputs and check if each equals its expected output. It should check all possible errors (for example, negative numbers, etc.).
