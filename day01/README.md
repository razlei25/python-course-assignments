# AI assitance for personal website

I used AI to build one part of my personal website (embedding the map) as well as for general guidance with styling and markdown syntax (instead of searching using a search engine).
I do not have the prompts saved, but I used both Chat GPT (GPT-4) and the copilot with model GPT-5 mini.


Other remarks:

* I linked to my lab but I don't have a page for myself only on the lab page so I didn't include that on my GitHub personal site.
